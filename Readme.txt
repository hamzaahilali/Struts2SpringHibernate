This website is created for purpose of studying and looking for a job ?  . Struts2, Spring and Hibernate framework are used, covering many the basics of them. I used JavaScript too, but it’s still a mess , I need more time to practice. 
I shared all the code on github. About 80% code on backend written by me, but just 30% on front end. Design front end is really interesting so I will learn it as soon as possible.
Take a look at these books and website is really useful, they help me starting from scratch ?
